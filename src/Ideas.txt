Step 1.
    Do Dijkstra's Algorithm to find all possible moves.
    Possible Moves: Moving one box one space.
Step 2.
    Develop a Graph where the nodes are the states and the edges are the set of moves it took to get to that state.
    Run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph. Slowly developing nodes as you progress.
Step 3.
    Print Shortest Path
